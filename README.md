# Puppy on diet

## A Simulation Game

This application is a game which animal-lovers will like.

The ultimate goal of this game is helping an obese puppy to lose
weight, and the player will be the owner. Your choices will determine 
if the puppy can become healthy again.

I got the inspiration from a mobile game called *Travel Frog*,
which is a kind of Simulation Game. I want to adopt some interesting 
features from *Travel Frog*, and add some unique elements into
my application.

**Feature Systems**
- Feeding System
- Workout System
